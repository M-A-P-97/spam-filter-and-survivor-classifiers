# Spam Filter & Titanic Survivor Predictions
#### Spam Mails and Titanic Dataset Analysis, 21/06/2020
#### By **M A P**
## Description
In this project I sought to try and predict whether emails are spam or ham as well as whether a passenger would survive on the titanic ship. 
You have two possible approaches (as shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

## Problem Statement 1 -- KNN Clasifier

Using the K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier and given a number of features, predict whether a passenger onboard the Titanic survived the shipwreck.

## Problem Statement 2 -- Naive Bayes Classifier

Given the features in the dataset, using Naive Bayes Classifier, we are to determine whether an email is spam or not.
